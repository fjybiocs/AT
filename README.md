# AT
Your players can mention an online player in you server! With highlighted mentioned username and sound reminder.

## Usage
Just send message with `@username`, the `@username` will be highlited and the mentioned user will receive special sound remind.

## Fetures
+ multiple mention: you can mention multiple players in a single message, for example, `What are you guys doing?@TPam@fjybiocs`
+ fuzzy matching: you don't need to type in the fullname of a user and don't need to be case sensitive. If you want to mention `TPam`, you can `@tpam`„ÄÅ`@tp` or something like that. But make sure that the username you entered does not have obvious ambiguity.
+ `@all`: op can mention all the online players via `@all`.

## Update Planning
+ more configurable: for example, configurable permission node, configurable message, ect.
+ send `@` message from the console.
